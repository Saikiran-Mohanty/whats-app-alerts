# What's App Alerts
A module for sending Alerts and Notifications via What's App



## TODO:

- Edit UI of Alerts and Notifications so that subject has hint about how to set up and send with What's App
```help
<a href="javascript:;" class="help ml-1" onclick="simpleDialog('If this checkbox is checked, any field variables (e.g., [date_of_birth]) that exist in the alert\'s subject or message    will not have their value piped if the field has been tagged as an \'Identifier\' field. In this case, it will simply replace    the field variable with [*DATA REMOVED*] rather than piping the actual data into the message.','Prevent piping of data for Identifier fields');">?</a>
```

- could add callback to verify if messages were successfully sent and log unsuccessful
messages...
